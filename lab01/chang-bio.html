                My name is Esther Chang. I am currently a senior computer science major with 
                interests in UX/UI Design and a growing interest in front-end development. I 
                gained an interest in UX Design last semester after taking a HCI (CIS 400) 
                course with Professor Farzana. Some accomplishments of mine are winning an essay 
                contest in 2018 and taking part in UX research over the summer at Siena College. 
                I worked at a bubble tea shop at my local mall over the summer too where I made many 
                of my closest friends today. A little bit about me is that I am from Albany, NY. 
                Outside of work, I enjoy cooking Korean food for my friends and family. I also enjoy 
                watching kdramas and walking around with my friends.
