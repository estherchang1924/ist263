        <h1>WELCOME TO THE CORAL REEF</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Coral Reef Ecosystem! Beneath the rolling waves, where sunlight ripples through turquoise waters, a hidden city of life awaits. Often mistaken for mere rocks, coral reefs are in fact living creatures. They rise like castles, alive with movement and color, each crevice sheltering creatures great and small. This beautiful, colorful ecosystem is home to all kinds of species from tiny fish, sea turtles, hunters patrolling the open blue. Step closer, and discover the wonders of this underwater realm!</p>

        <h3>CORAL</h3>
        <p>Corals are built from tiny living animals known as polyps. Each polyp has a simple body with a
        mouth surrounded by stinging tentacles, which it uses to catch food like plankton and small fish.
        When many polyps grow and fuse together, they create a colony‚Äîthe structure we see and
        identify as coral. Their brilliant colors come from microscopic algae called zooxanthellae that live
        within the coral‚Äôs tissues. These algae harness sunlight through photosynthesis, providing the
        corals with essential energy and nutrients</p>

        <h3>CLOWNFISH</h3>
        <p>Famously known for its starring role in Disney‚Äôs Finding Nemo, this colorful fish is a star in the coral reef as well! Clownfish live in anemone, which serves as a protector, home, and feeder to them: being able to hide from predators and eating food scraps provided by the anemone. Clownfish are omnivores, eating both meat and plants. Their diet is diverse ranging from crustaceans to algae. They live in groups consisting of one female and multiple male fish. Clownfish are all born male, just like Nemo! When a female from the group dies, a male turns into a female permanently.</p>
        <h3>BLUE TANG</h3>
        <p>Do you remember the fish with short term memory loss that helped Marlin find Nemo? That‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs Dory! They live in the crevices and holes of the coral reef. Although they are well known for their beautiful blue color, they come in two other colors throughout their life: yellow and white with gray stripes! It‚Äôs yellow in its adolescent stage and while it matures, its body encompasses gray stripes during the night. This fish loves to eat algae so much that it‚Äôs their entire diet!</p>

        <h3>MORAY EEL</h3>
        <p>These eels are found worldwide! During the daytime, they usually stay hidden: only coming out during the nighttime. One of the carnivore predators of the coral reef, their diet consists of fish, crustaceans, and other smaller creatures. Although they are not considered aggressive creatures, be aware of these eels! If bitten by these creatures, you can get an infection, swelling or difficulty breathing, loss of limb function, and septicemia.</p>
        <h3>SEA HORSE</h3>
        <p>Although these creatures can‚Äôt gallop throughout the fields like horses, this fish got its name for their head and neck‚Äôs resemblance to a horse. Seahorses come in a variety of colors including purple, yellow, orange, and green. These are not fixed due to their mood and camouflaging abilities. Although they don‚Äôt have a stomach, they primarily eat small crustaceans. They use their snout to suck their food in and pass it through their inefficient digestive system. Another fun fact: unlike humans, the male gets pregnant and gives birth to the offspring!</p>

        <h3>REEF MANTA RAY</h3>
        <p>Among the largest fish species, reef manta rays gracefully swim across the coral reef with their wing-like fins. This fish has an amazing anatomy. It has a nickname of the ‚Äúdevil ray‚Äù due to its cephalic lobes‚Äô resemblance of horns. It doesn‚Äôt have any bones in its body, instead its body is made up of cartilage. It has 6-8 rows of teeth on the center of the lower jaw that they use to primarily feed on plankton, but also smaller fish. They also have been seen sometimes jumping out of water!</p>
        <h3>SEA TURTLE</h3>
        <p>Sea turtles are the beautiful reptiles of the coral reef, being one of the oldest reptiles in the world. They can be distinguished by their beautiful, unique shells and scales. They eat a variety of things, ranging from jellyfish to sponges. Although they are marine animals, their relationship with the sand is very important. Sea turtles hatch their eggs in the sand, where the temperature of the sand also determines the sex of the sea turtles that are about to hatch. Cooler sand hatches male sea turtles, while warmer sand hatches female sea turtles. When these turtles grow older and it‚Äôs time to hatch their own eggs, they‚Äôll return to the same beach they‚Äôre from to do so!</p>

        <h3>REEF SHARKS</h3>
        <p>SHARK!! There are many different types of reef sharks: the blacktip shark, blacktip reef shark, whitetip reef shark, sicklefin lemon shark, galapagos shark, caribbean reef shark, grey reef shark, and more! They have a role in keeping the ecosystem balanced: preventing any species from overpopulating and getting rid of sick animals by preying on them. Although they are the top predators of the reef, they are harmless to humans. They tend to be shy when divers encounter them in the wild, maintaining a good distance.</p>
