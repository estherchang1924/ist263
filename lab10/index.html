                <p>My name is Esther Chang. I am currently a senior <strong>computer science major </strong> with interests in <strong>UX/UI Design</strong> and a growing interest in front-end development. I gained an interest in UX Design last semester after taking a HCI (CIS 400) course with Dr. Farzana Rahman. Some accomplishments of mine are winning an essay 
                contest in 2018 and taking part in UX research over the summer at Siena College. 
                I worked at a bubble tea shop at my local mall over the summer too where I made many 
                of my closest friends today. <br> A little bit about me is that I am from Albany, NY. 
                Outside of work, I enjoy cooking Korean food for my friends and family. I also enjoy 
                watching kdramas and walking around with my friends. </p>
                <p>My favorite Korean dramas/movies</p>
